## ℹ️ How to Add Video and Screenshot Links in Markdown

### To add a screenshot:
```markdown
![Alt text for screenshot](PATH_OR_URL_TO_IMAGE)
```
_Example:_
```markdown
![App Screenshot](frontend/public/vite.svg)
```

### To add a video link:
```markdown
[Text to display](URL_TO_VIDEO)
```
_Example:_
```markdown
[Watch the Resumez Demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID)
```

> To embed a YouTube video directly (not all markdown renderers support this), use:
```markdown
[![Demo Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUR_VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID)
```
Replace `YOUR_VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of your YouTube video.
